## The Interplay between Emotions and Irony in Text Classification

### Classifiers:
1) Emotion classifier: RoBERTa, with preprocessing
2) Emotion classifier: RoBERTa, without preprocessing
3) Emotion classifier: RoBERTa, with emojis
4) Emotion classifier: RoBERTa, without emojis
5) Irony Detector: RoBERTa, with emojis
6) Irony Detector: RoBERTa, without emojis

The classifiers are in the form of .py files

### Experiments:
1) Experiment 1: do emotion labels improve irony detection performance?
2) Experiment 2: do irony labels improve emotion classification performance?
3) Experiment 3: are there features that can be considered indicators of irony?
4) Experiment 4: what emotions does irony appear most often with?

The experiments can be found in this repository (notebooks), however, I suggest opening them directly by clicking on this link. It directs to a folder with the original Google Colab notebooks, with table of contents that are useful to browse through the files.
